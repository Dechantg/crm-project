Roles Table:

Create a table to store different roles.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE roles (
  role_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  role_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
Permissions Table:

Create a table to store different permissions (e.g., read, write, delete) for each route and table.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE permissions (
  permission_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  route_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  table_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  
  can_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_write BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
Users Table:

Create a table to store user information and associate each user with a specific role.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(role_id)
);
User_Permissions Table:

Create a table to associate users with specific permissions based on their roles.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE user_permissions (
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
  permission_id INTEGER REFERENCES permissions(permission_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, permission_id)
);
In this setup, you can define different roles (e.g., "editor", "reader") and associate different permissions for each route and table. Users are then assigned to roles, and their specific permissions are determined by their role assignments.

Example Queries:

Retrieve all permissions for a user:

sql
Copy code
SELECT route_name, table_name, can_read, can_write, can_delete
FROM user_permissions up
JOIN permissions p ON up.permission_id = p.permission_id
WHERE up.user_id = :userId;
Check if a user has permission to write to a specific route and table:

sql
Copy code
SELECT can_write
FROM user_permissions up
JOIN permissions p ON up.permission_id = p.permission_id
WHERE up.user_id = :userId
AND p.route_name = :routeName
AND p.table_name = :tableName;
This structure allows for flexibility and scalability, as you can easily add new roles, permissions, and associate them with users as your application grows and your authorization requirements become more complex.
