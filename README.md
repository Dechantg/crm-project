# crm-project

This is a personal project being done after finishing Lighthouse Labs Web Dev Intensive program

The objective is to create specialized CRM software for wine and spirits agencies in Canada. There is currently a gap for comprehensive programs that the small to medium side agencies who do not have the budget for large platforms.

As this was a personal issue when working the the field it is a passion project I hope to make viable. I am working with one of my previous agency employers to make sure the software is practical for their needs.
